										<h2>What is FIRST Robotics?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST)
										is a non-profit organization that aims to inspire students to
										pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers.
										It achieves this goal by challenging students to participate in a
										rigorous robotics competition each year that partners them with
										industry professionals as mentors. For more information about the
										FIRST robotics program or the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC),
										check out the links below!
